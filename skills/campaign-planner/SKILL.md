# Campaign Planner

Generate a comprehensive Meta Ads campaign proposal for any brand, based on their products, positioning, and competitor learnings.

## Prerequisites

Before running this skill, you should have:

1. **Brand Bible** — Run `/website_brand_analysis` first, or have existing brand guidelines
2. **Competitor Analysis** (optional but recommended) — Run `/meta_ads_analyser` on 1-2 competitors to identify winning patterns

## Inputs

| Input | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Brand guidelines | Brand bible or `/website_brand_analysis` output | ✅ Yes |
| Product ladder | From brand bible (pricing, tiers) | ✅ Yes |
| Competitor analysis | From `/meta_ads_analyser` output | ⭕ Recommended |
| Target audience | From brand bible ICP section | ✅ Yes |
| Existing assets | Landing pages, lead magnets, etc. | ⭕ Optional |

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Load brand bible** — Products, pricing, voice, visual style
2. **Load competitor analysis** (if available) — Winning patterns, funnel structures
3. **Identify product ladder** — Free → Low-ticket → High-ticket → Enterprise
4. **Note existing assets** — What landing pages/lead magnets already exist?

### Phase 2: Design Funnel Strategy

Map the customer journey:

```
TOFU (Cold Traffic)
├── Lead magnets (quiz, free course, valuable content)
├── Goal: Email capture, pixel building
└── Budget: 50-60%

MOFU (Warm Traffic — Retargeting)
├── Low-to-mid ticket offers
├── Goal: First purchase, course sales
└── Budget: 30-40%

BOFU (Hot Traffic — High Intent)
├── High-ticket / enterprise offers
├── Goal: Sales calls, team deals
└── Budget: 10-15%
```

### Phase 3: Define Landing Pages

For each funnel stage, recommend landing pages:

**TOFU Landing Pages:**
- Quiz/assessment pages (high conversion, low friction)
- Free course/lead magnet pages
- Tutorial/value content pages

**MOFU Landing Pages:**
- Paid traffic variants of product pages
- More aggressive than organic pages
- Include: price anchoring, urgency, testimonials

**BOFU Landing Pages:**
- Existing sales pages
- "Book a call" pages
- Case study pages

### Phase 4: Design Ad Creatives

Create 6-10 ad concepts across the funnel:

**TOFU Ads (3-4 creatives):**
- Video: Hook + problem + free offer CTA (25-35s)
- Image: Native/organic style (doesn't look like ad)
- Carousel: Value bomb / tutorial teaser

**MOFU Ads (2-3 creatives):**
- Video: Identity + agitation + solution + proof (30-40s)
- Image: Price anchoring, transformation

**BOFU Ads (1-2 creatives):**
- Video: Case study, results-focused (35-45s)
- Image: Social proof, consultation CTA

### Phase 5: Write Video Scripts

For each video ad, write a full script with:

```
[TIMESTAMP] SECTION NAME
"Dialogue / voiceover text"

Visual notes: What's on screen
```

**Script structure:**
1. **Hook (0-3s)** — Pattern interrupt, curiosity, or identity call-out
2. **Problem (3-10s)** — Agitate the pain point
3. **Solution (10-20s)** — Introduce the offer
4. **Proof (20-30s)** — Testimonials, numbers, credibility
5. **CTA (last 5s)** — Clear next step

### Phase 6: Define Image Ad Concepts

For each image ad, describe:
- **Concept** — What style/approach
- **Text on image** — Actual copy
- **Visual notes** — Design direction
- **Landing page** — Where it drives

**Image styles that work:**
- Native/organic (notebook, text post)
- Bold claim + price
- Before/after
- Tutorial preview
- Quote/testimonial

### Phase 7: Budget & Testing Plan

**Budget allocation:**
- TOFU: 50-60%
- MOFU: 30-40%
- BOFU: 10-15%

**Testing phases:**
1. Weeks 1-2: TOFU testing, find winning lead magnet
2. Weeks 3-4: MOFU activation, first sales
3. Weeks 5-8: Optimization, scaling winners

### Phase 8: Generate Outputs

Create two files:

1. **Markdown** — `{brand}-campaign-proposal.md`
2. **HTML** — `{brand}-campaign-proposal.html`

Both should include:
- Executive summary
- Funnel strategy with diagram
- Landing page recommendations
- Ad creative cards (with scripts/concepts)
- Budget allocation
- Testing plan
- Approval checklist

**Save to:** `~/clawd/output/`

### Phase 9: Deliver & Get Approval

Send both files to user with summary:
- Number of landing pages proposed
- Number of ad creatives
- Key strategic decisions to approve

**Include approval checklist:**
1. ✅/❌ Overall funnel strategy
2. ✅/❌ Landing page concepts
3. ✅/❌ Ad creative concepts
4. ✅/❌ Video scripts
5. ✅/❌ Budget allocation

**Wait for approval before creating actual assets.**

## Patterns from Competitor Analysis

When competitor analysis is available, apply these patterns:

| Pattern | How to Apply |
|---------|--------------|
| Quiz/assessment TOFU | Create a quiz lead magnet if none exists |
| Credibility stacking | Add logos/credentials in first 10s of video |
| Two-tier funnel | Separate cold and warm audiences clearly |
| Native creative | Include at least one "doesn't look like an ad" image |
| Identity-driven copy | Use "you're the kind of person who..." language |
| Price anchoring | Compare low-ticket to high-ticket alternative |

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill works best when combined with:

1. **`/website_brand_analysis`** — Generate brand bible first
2. **`/meta_ads_extractor`** → **`/meta_ads_analyser`** — Analyze competitor ads
3. After approval: Create assets (landing pages, video scripts, images)

## Tips for Better Proposals

1. **Lead with strategy, not tactics** — Explain the funnel logic before listing ads
2. **Show the math** — If possible, estimate CAC, LTV, ROAS
3. **Include native creative** — At least one ad that doesn't look like an ad
4. **Write real scripts** — Don't leave placeholders, write actual dialogue
5. **Make approval easy** — Clear checklist at the end
6. **Visual mockups help** — Even text-based mockups of image ads
