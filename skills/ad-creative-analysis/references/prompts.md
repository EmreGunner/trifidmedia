# Analysis Prompts

## Video Ad Analysis Prompt

```
You are an expert ads analyst and media buyer. Analyze this video ad in detail.

1. **Hook (first 3 seconds):** What stops the scroll? What do you see AND hear immediately? Is it pattern-interrupt, curiosity gap, bold claim, or something else?
2. **Script/Voiceover:** Transcribe the full spoken content verbatim. Note tone, pacing, and delivery style.
3. **Visual Approach:** Describe the visual style and how it evolves through the ad. Categories: talking head, UGC/testimonial, b-roll, motion graphics, screen recording, text-on-screen, mixed. Note transitions, text overlays, and any branded elements.
4. **Emotional Angle:** What primary emotion drives this ad? (fear of missing out, aspiration, curiosity, pain/frustration, social proof, urgency, authority, belonging). How is it established?
5. **CTA:** What specific action are they driving? How is it presented (verbal, text overlay, button, end card)? What's the friction level (free vs paid, quiz vs purchase)?
6. **Ad Format:** Aspect ratio (9:16, 1:1, 16:9), estimated duration, platform optimization (captions, safe zones, sound-on vs sound-off friendly).
7. **What Makes It Work:** 2-3 specific tactical takeaways. Why would this ad outperform? What can a marketing team replicate?
8. **Weaknesses:** What could be improved? Be specific and actionable.

Be direct and tactical — this analysis is for a marketing team studying competitor ads, not a general audience.

2. **Copy:** Transcribe ALL text in the creative. Note headline vs body vs CTA text hierarchy.
3. **Visual Approach:** Style (photography, illustration, graphic design, UGC, meme-style, screenshot). Color palette, typography choices, use of faces/people, brand elements.

5. **CTA:** What action is implied or stated? Button text, urgency elements, friction level.
6. **Ad Format:** Dimensions/aspect ratio, platform optimization (text density for Facebook's old 20% rule, safe zones).

## Comparative Analysis Prompt

Use after analyzing individual ads from the same advertiser. Provide summaries of each ad analyzed, then:

```
You are an expert ads analyst reviewing multiple ads from the same advertiser. Based on the individual analyses provided, identify:

1. **Creative Patterns:** What elements repeat across their ads? (visual style, hooks, emotional angles, CTA types)
2. **Testing Strategy:** What are they likely A/B testing? (different hooks for same offer? different audiences? different formats?)
3. **Funnel Consistency:** Do all ads drive to the same destination/offer, or are they running multiple funnels?
4. **Top Performer Signals:** Based on the creative quality and approach, which ad likely performs best and why?
5. **Lessons for Our Ads:** 3-5 specific, actionable takeaways we can apply to our own ad creative.

Be specific. Reference individual ads by number when making comparisons.
