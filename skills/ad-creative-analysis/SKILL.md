# Ad Creative Analysis

Analyze ad creatives like a media buyer — not generic descriptions, but tactical breakdowns of what makes ads work.

## Video Ad Analysis

Upload video to Gemini Files API, then run analysis via `gemini-2.0-flash`.

### Step 1: Upload video

```bash
FILE_SIZE=$(wc -c < "$VIDEO_PATH" | tr -d ' ')

# Start resumable upload
UPLOAD_URL=$(curl -s -i -X POST \
  "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/upload/v1beta/files?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Protocol: resumable" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Command: start" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Length: $FILE_SIZE" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Header-Content-Type: video/mp4" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"file\": {\"displayName\": \"$(basename $VIDEO_PATH)\"}}" \
  | grep -i 'x-goog-upload-url' | tr -d '\r' | cut -d' ' -f2)

# Upload file
RESULT=$(curl -s -X POST "$UPLOAD_URL" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Command: upload, finalize" \
  -H "X-Goog-Upload-Offset: 0" \
  -H "Content-Length: $FILE_SIZE" \
  --data-binary @"$VIDEO_PATH")

FILE_URI=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.file.uri')
```

Wait for `state: "ACTIVE"` before proceeding (poll with GET on the file URI + API key).

### Step 2: Analyze with Gemini

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash:generateContent?key=$GEMINI_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contents": [{"parts": [
      {"fileData": {"mimeType": "video/mp4", "fileUri": "'"$FILE_URI"'"}},
      {"text": "<ANALYSIS_PROMPT>"}
    ]}],
    "generationConfig": {"temperature": 0.3, "maxOutputTokens": 2000}
  }'
```

Use the analysis prompt from `references/prompts.md` — select the appropriate variant (video, image, or comparative).

## Image Ad Analysis

Use the built-in `image` tool directly — no upload step needed. Pass the image file path and the image analysis prompt from `references/prompts.md`.

## Output Format

All analysis follows a consistent structure. See `references/prompts.md` for the full prompt templates that produce this format:

1. **Hook** — First 3 seconds (video) or first impression (image). What stops the scroll?
2. **Script/Copy** — Full voiceover transcript (video) or all text in the creative (image)
3. **Visual Approach** — Style, transitions, format (talking head, UGC, motion graphics, etc.)
4. **Emotional Angle** — Primary emotion driving the ad (fear, aspiration, curiosity, urgency, etc.)
5. **CTA** — What action, how presented, friction level
6. **Ad Format** — Aspect ratio, duration, platform optimization
7. **What Makes It Work** — Tactical takeaways for your own ads
8. **Weaknesses** — What could be improved

## Comparative Analysis

When analyzing multiple ads from the same advertiser, add a comparison section after individual analyses. See the comparative prompt in `references/prompts.md`. Covers:

- Creative patterns (what do they repeat across ads?)
- Testing strategy (what are they A/B testing?)
- Funnel consistency (do all ads drive to the same offer?)

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill is designed to work alongside:
- **meta-ads-library** — Extract ads, then analyze each creative
- **landing-page-analysis** — Analyze the destination page behind the CTA

Typical pipeline: extract → analyze creative → analyze landing page → compile report.
